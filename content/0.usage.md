# Usage

## 0. TypeScript Project 
Obviously you need a TypeScript project to start with. Here is a Starter Typesciprt Project Example: [Click Here](https://khalilstemmler.com/blogs/typescript/node-starter-project/) 

## 1. Install the Package
First, you need to install the package using the following command:

::code-group
  ```bash [Yarn]
  yarn add easyscript.ts
  ```
  ```bash [NPM]
  npm install easyscript.ts
  ```
::

## 2. Import Modules
Second, you need to import all of the modules you would like to use.

```ts
// List all of the modules you want to use in the brackets
// Example: { flip, print, random }
import { print } from "easyscript.ts"
```

## 3. Use Easy Script
Now that you have installed and imported any modules you would like to use, you can now start using them!

```ts
import { print } from "easyscript.ts"

print("Hello World");
```

Output:
:badge[Hello World]
